The model can also be used to filter search results by brand, making it easier for people to find the exact bag they are looking for.

5. Fashion Trend Analysis: By analyzing images on social media platforms or fashion magazines, the "Detection bag logo" model can track the popularity of different designer bag brands over time. This data can inform industry professionals about current trends, helping them make strategic decisions related to marketing, product development, and pricing.
