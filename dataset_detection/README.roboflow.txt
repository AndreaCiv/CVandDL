The following pre-processing was applied to each image:

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Random rotation of between -45 and +45 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -40 and +40 percent
